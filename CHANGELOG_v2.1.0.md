## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### ✅ Customer Import Error Fix

**Issue:**
```
Error: Field 'customer_code' doesn't have a default value
```

**Root Cause:**
- Database field `customer_code` was NOT NULL but had no default value
- Application attempted to insert empty string instead of NULL or valid value

**Solution:**
1. **Database Schema Update:**
   - Changed `customer_code` to allow NULL values
   - Type: `VARCHAR(191) UNIQUE NULL`

2. **Code Improvements:**
   - Generate unique customer codes: `CUST-{timestamp}-{random}`
   - Fallback to NULL if generation fails
   - Updated both `customerController.ts` and `excelController.ts`

3. **Import Status:**
   - Now handles missing customer codes gracefully
   - No more import failures on this field

### ✅ Delete Button UX Issues

**Issue:**
- Delete button always visible near filter
- Unclear purpose and confusing placement
- Users unsure when to use it

**Solution:**
- Removed fixed delete button from header
- Implemented smart inline action bar
- Only appears when items are selected via checkbox
- Clear visual feedback with selected count
- Modern confirmation modal for safety

### ✅ Text Visibility Problems

**Issue:**
- Text not readable on light/pastel backgrounds
- Icons invisible due to poor contrast
- Scheduler status box creating visual noise

**Solution:**
- Switched to dark gradient backgrounds
- Applied white text with drop shadows
- Ensured WCAG AA contrast compliance (4.5:1 minimum)
- Removed unnecessary background boxes
