## Upgrade Instructions

### From 1.x to 2.0.0

The 2.0.0 release focuses on installation improvements. No breaking changes to the application itself.

**If you installed manually before:**
1. Backup your database: `./backup-db.sh` or manual mysqldump
2. Pull latest code: `git pull origin main`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install --production`
4. Rebuild: `npm run build`
5. Restart: `pm2 restart billing-system`

**New installations:**
- Use one-click install script: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adiprayitno160-svg/billing/main/install.sh | bash`

**No database migrations required** - This is purely an installation/deployment improvement.
