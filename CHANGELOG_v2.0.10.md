## üêõ Bug Fixes

  - Modified `excelController.ts` to generate unique customer codes
  - Added fallback to NULL if code generation fails
  - Format: `CUST-{timestamp}-{random}` for uniqueness

- **Solution:**
  - Removed fixed delete button from header
  - Implemented inline bulk action bar that appears only when items are selected
  - Added clear "Cancel" and "Delete Selected" actions
  - Shows count of selected items dynamically

### Text Contrast Issues
- **Issue:** Text not visible on light/pastel backgrounds
- **Solution:**
  - Changed to dark gradient backgrounds
